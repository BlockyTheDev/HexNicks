Welcome to the HexNicks docs!

This documentation is a constant work in progress so if you feel something is missing feel free to open an issue. The wiki is organized into different pages for things like commands, permissions, etc. If you have questions the wiki doesn't cover, please either post in [discussions](https://github.com/Majekdor/HexNicks/discussions) or join my [Discord](https://discord.majek.dev).

The HexNicks code lives on GitHub. If you have a bug report, or even a feature request, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/Majekdor/HexNicks/issues). The issues tab does not have to be just issues with the plugin, you are welcome to open an issue for an idea you have for improvement. There is also the [discussions](https://github.com/Majekdor/HexNicks/discussions) tab where you're welcome to post, please just follow the guidelines from this [post](https://github.com/Majekdor/HexNicks/discussions/28).
